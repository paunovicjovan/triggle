# Triggle

Turn-based strategy game implemented in **Python** using **Tkinter**, developed as a project for the *Artificial Intelligence* course at the Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Niš.  
The game allows two players to compete against each other, or one player to play against the computer powered by the **MinMax algorithm**.

## Features

- **Game Modes**
  - Player vs Player
  - Player vs Computer (AI opponent using MinMax)

- **Artificial Intelligence**
  - MinMax algorithm with configurable depth
  - Pruning of invalid moves for optimized decision-making

- **User Interface**
  - Interactive board rendered with Tkinter
  - Highlighting of selected moves

- **Gameplay Mechanics**
